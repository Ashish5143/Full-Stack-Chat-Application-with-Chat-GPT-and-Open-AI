### Build a Chat Application with ChatEngine and OpenAI and ChatGPT integration tutorial. The frontend will consist of ChatEngine for our chat application, Redux Toolkit for our state management, Redux Toolkit Query for making api calls, Hero icons for our Icons and React Router for Navigation. For the backend we will be using Node Js as our runtime, Express Js as our backend framework, and OpenAI for Ai integration with our chat. We will be able to talk through our chat application like with ChatGPT.
